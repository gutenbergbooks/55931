<h2 id="c1"><i>Foreword</i></h2>
<p>Along the strand of the Pacific between
San Diego and Sonoma, the intrepid
monks of the Order of Saint Francis strung
that cordon of missions that were to become,
as time went on, the outposts of
civilization along the sunset coast of
California.</p>
<p>Begun in 1769, this chain of churches
along <i>El Camino Real</i> was complete by
1823, and in these establishments the devoted
followers of Padre Jun&iacute;pero Serra
sought to win for Christ and the Crown of
Spain devotees among the dusky inhabitants
of this land. How well they succeeded
<span class="pb" id="Page_6">6</span>
may be judged when we learn that often in
the more prosperous missions as many as
two thousand Indians were being trained
at one time.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig7">

<div class="caption">
<p class="caphead"><i>Cloister, San Diego De Alcal&aacute;</i></p>
</div></div>
<p>And what was the routine by which
these fervent priests of Old Spain hoped
to convert the backward natives of the
coast into God-fearing, self-supporting and
self-respecting subjects of his Hispanic
majesty, the king? The system of training
prescribed plenty of work accompanied by
instruction in the handcrafts and Christian
doctrine. To this end, each day, the morning
bell assembled the Indians in the
chapel for prayers and mass. Following
this, breakfast was eaten, after which each
went to his assigned task. At eleven o&rsquo;clock
dinner was eaten; then a siesta. Work, resumed
at 2 P.M., continued until an hour
before sunset, when the Angelus recalled
all to worship. After prayers and rosary,
supper was eaten, after which recreation
ensued until early bedtime.</p>

<p>This was the happy pattern of life that
obtained in these picturesque missions
which at once comprised the early
churches, the first schools, the first factories
and the work-a-day habitations of
<span class="pb" id="Page_9">9</span>
the priests and their charges. Viewed in
this light these old buildings become real
human documents and are therefore very
precious to all interested in the beginnings
of civilization within our broad land.</p>

<p>Through the glamor that time and an
exotic origin have cast over these old monuments,
they continue to hold for us a
fascination matched by that of few American
structures. And, in journeying to these
historic shrines, you will discover how
these hard-headed priests, in sheltering
their converts, created in simplicity and
strength a type of architecture which considered
from the standpoint of practical
living, climatic background, materials of
construction and ethnic significance, has
rarely been equalled in any land. What a
matchless artistic heritage they have left us!</p>

<h2 id="c2"><i>California Missions</i></h2>
<p>San Diego was first visited by Juan
Rodriguez Cabrillo in 1542, but it was not
until two hundred and twenty-seven years
later that the fear that Russia or England
might take possession of California induced
King Carlos III of Spain to organize
an expedition to colonize the land. It was
in 1769 that a band of about two hundred
men set out by land and sea to settle in
Alta California. In the last company to
come overland was Padre Jun&iacute;pero Serra,
who, although already advanced in age,
had been appointed <i>Padre Presidente</i> of
the missions. This extraordinary man entered
into a life of utmost hardship with a
fiery enthusiasm that was never dampened
throughout his life, and to him we owe the
chain of historic missions that provide the
only link to connect us with the early life
of California and Spain. Twenty-one of
these were established in California, forming
an irregular line reaching from San
Diego to Sonoma, and connected by El
Camino Real (The Royal Road). Today
the modern highway along the coast, U. S.
101, follows so closely the course of this
road established by the pioneers one hundred
and seventy years ago that one can
easily say one is following in the footsteps
of Father Serra and his companions.</p>

<p>On July 16th, 1769, sixteen days after his
arrival in San Diego, Father Serra established
the first mission in California&mdash;the
Mission San Diego de Alcal&aacute;. The original
site was unsatisfactory so a spot was later
chosen six miles back from the ocean in
Mission Valley where the present buildings
now stand. San Diego was one of the
wealthiest of the missions. It had extensive
orchards and vineyards, irrigated by
an aqueduct which brought water from the
valley. Parts of the old mission dam which
was twelve feet thick, may still be seen.
The olive trees around the Mission form
the mother orchard of all California mission
olives. The whole Mission has been
restored in every detail. Its belfry, one of
the most magnificent of all the missions, is
a three-story wall pierced by five arches in
which hang the old bells.</p>

<p>Four miles inland from Oceanside, in a
beautiful valley, stands Mission San Luis
Rey de Francia. The present buildings were
started in 1811 by Father Peyri, who managed
the Mission for thirty years. It is now
used as a church and a Franciscan college.
A feature not found in any other mission is
the mortuary chapel, a small octagonal
shaped room off the main chapel. San Luis
Rey is typically Spanish in its architecture
and while not one of the most beautiful,
it has a stately magnificence that none of
the other missions possesses.</p>

<p>Twenty miles inland from Mission San
Luis Rey stands San Antonio de Pala,
founded as an asistencia. In its chapel are
Indian frescoes covered for many years
with a coat of whitewash given the wall
by a well-meaning padre. Its campanile, in
which hang the original bells, stands in the
old cemetery. Pala, nestling at the base of
the Palomar Mountains, is a spot of enchanting
beauty.</p>

<p>The first attempt to found San Juan
Capistrano was in 1775, but due to an
Indian uprising Father Lasu&eacute;n was forced
to return to San Diego. The next year
Father Serra came and established the Mission.
It took nine years to build and was
the largest and most beautiful of all. In
1812 there was an earthquake that destroyed
the buildings and killed forty Indians
who were worshiping in the chapel.
All of the buildings have been rebuilt except
the chapel, of which one of the seven
large domes still stands in its lonely grandeur,
a delight to the artist. Capistrano,
elaborately decorated and artistically constructed,
is sometimes called &ldquo;Jewel of the
Missions.&rdquo;</p>

<p>San Gabriel Arc&aacute;ngel was a welcomed
pause in the long journey from Mexico to
Monterey; it was the first stop after crossing
the desert and mountains. It is distinctively
Moorish in its architecture. Its
high buttressed walls are stone to the windows
and brick above and have an outside
stairway to the choir loft and campanile.
In the courtyard is one of the largest and
oldest grape vines in California.</p>

<p>At one time Mission San Fernando Rey
de Espa&ntilde;a had an Indian population of
eleven hundred. Today nothing remains
of the Mission but one large building. In
it one can see the wine cellar and the large
copper brandy still. Across the street is a
large star-shaped fountain copied from one
in Cordova, Spain, a monument to the
artistic work of the Indians.</p>

<p>Half-way between San Diego and Monterey,
Father Serra founded the Mission
Buenaventura. It was the last founded by
him. On a hill above the mission he
planted a cross that could be seen from
both land and sea. Today, a replica of the
cross stands in the same place. Ventura
was noted for its beautiful gardens but of
these nothing remains except two tall
palms. The chapel has been restored and is
used daily as a place of worship.</p>

<p>Mission Santa B&aacute;rbara has never fallen
into a state of decay like its less fortunate
sister missions, as it has always been in the
hands of its founders, the Franciscans.
Although damaged by numerous earthquakes,
the last in 1925, it has always been
faithfully restored. The light above the
altar has never gone out, the old bells have
faithfully rung the call to Mass. Its walls,
six feet thick and mellowed by time, impart
a lasting beauty. The bodies of over
four thousand Indians lie in its tree-shadowed
cemetery. In front of the Mission
the trickling water from an old fountain
gives one the restful feeling of the old
Spanish siesta. It was at this mission that
the great historian, Father Engelhardt,
<span class="pb" id="Page_33">33</span>
wrote his great book, &ldquo;Missions and Missionaries
of California.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mission Santa In&eacute;z was founded to convert
the Indians who lived east of the Coast
Range. The Mission not only suffered from
earthquakes but also from an Indian uprising.
Today it has been restored to its
former grandeur. Its campanile with its
three bells reminds one of Mission San
Gabriel. In its museum is a collection of
old vestments and books.</p>
<p>Nothing remained of Mission La Pur&iacute;sima
Concepti&oacute;n but a few crumbling
arches, till it was taken over by the state.
Today it stands in all its former glory,
faithfully restored in every detail. The Mission
site was made a State park and the
restoration carried out by the Civilian Conservation
Corps. Pur&iacute;sima stands as a monument
to a nation&rsquo;s industry, but lacks the
peaceful state of religious tranquility found
in the other missions.</p>

The design painted on the walls by
the Indians show large fluted pillars with
a balcony and railing above. The floor is
of burned brick, worn smooth by the tread
of bare feet. Its crudely decorated pulpit
and confessional are the same as the day
they were built. The Mission did not have
a bell-tower so the bell was mounted on a
wooden scaffold. To enter the ancient
edifice is to enter directly into the past.</p>

<p>Father Serra founded his third Mission,
San Antonio de Padua, in a well wooded
valley. When the bells rang in celebration
an Indian appeared out of the trees, and
for the first time a native was present at
the founding of a mission. Its quiet surroundings
are very much as they were in
the past. The buildings were constructed
of brick instead of adobe. Parts of a stone-walled
irrigation ditch which brought
water for many miles still stand near at
hand.</p>
<p>Monterey was used as a mission for but
one year and then became the Presidio
Chapel. Behind the Mission is the tree
under which the first Mass in California
was offered. Many of the old relics of the
early Church are preserved here. It is now
the San Carlos Parish Church.</p>

<p>When Father Serra decided to move the
Mission from Monterey he chose a site
about five miles away where the Rio Carmelo
enters the sea. Here he founded Mission
San Carlos Borromeo, which became
the headquarters of the <i>Padre Presidentes</i>
of the California missions. In its quiet
sanctuary are the graves of Father Serra,
Lasu&eacute;n, Crespi and L&oacute;pez, names famous
in the history of the missions. Father Serra
spent most of his life at San Carlos. His
cell, measuring about eleven feet square,
has been restored. The building is Moorish
in style.</p>

Mission grounds.</p>
<p>Mission San Juan Bautista stands facing
the plaza in the old pueblo of San Juan. It
was here that Helen Hunt Jackson began
her famous story, &ldquo;Ramona&rdquo; and Joaquin
Murrietta, the famous Mexican bandit,
worshipped. San Juan saw great activity
during the gold rush as it was a stage stop
on the road to the mines. The long arcade
that extends the whole length of the building,
contains twenty arches. In the garden
is a sundial, placed there by the padres. Its
old cemetery is in an olive grove whose
trees cast fantastic shadows on the time
worn headstones.</p>

<p>Mission San Jos&eacute; de Guadalupe was
at one time the most prosperous of all the
missions. In livestock alone it had 12,000
cattle, 13,000 horses and 13,000 sheep. It
was the centre of social life for the surrounding
ranches and the stopping place
for the Forty-niners who used the Mission
Pass between San Francisco and the mines.
Only a part of the living quarters remains
today. Beside this building is the old cemetery,
back of which is the Mission garden.</p>

<p>There was nothing in the original plans
of the missions to name one after St. Francis,
the founder of the Franciscan Order.
The Mexican Visitador said, &ldquo;If Saint
Francis wishes a mission, let him show you
a good port, and let it bear his name.&rdquo;
When Portol&aacute; discovered San Francisco
Bay he decided that it was the place the
Visitador meant, but it was not until seven
years later that the Mission San Francisco
de As&iacute;s was founded. It was commonly
called Dolores after a small river that
flowed through the Mission grounds. It is
quite different in its architecture from the
other missions. It has neither archway nor
towers but a massive fa&ccedil;ade. Today it
stands in quiet simplicity, surrounded on
all sides by modern buildings of the Catholic
Church.</p>

<p>Fear of the Russians caused the Governor
to ask Father Altimira to establish a
mission at Sonoma. He did this without
the sanction of the Church authorities.
Mission San Francisco Solano was the last
and the most northerly of the twenty-one
missions. It is a plain low building, facing
the plaza.</p>
<p>Of the twenty-one missions originally
built one is completely gone, another a
crumbling wall of adobe, and the remainder
in only partial restoration. May
they all some day be restored to their original
grandeur, and the romance and history
of Old California again be found in their
splendid old walls.</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will
be renamed.

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

The Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the
mailing address: PO Box 750175, Fairbanks, AK 99775, but its
volunteers and employees are scattered throughout numerous
locations. Its business office is located at 809 North 1500 West, Salt
Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up to

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
